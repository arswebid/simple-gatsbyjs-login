To create a login page in GatsbyJS, you can use any of the existing authentication libraries such as Firebase Authentication or Auth0. Here's an example of how to create a login page using Firebase Authentication:

First, install Firebase SDK for JavaScript by running npm install firebase.
Set up a Firebase project and enable Firebase Authentication. You will also need to create a Firebase web app and obtain your Firebase config details.
Create a new file called firebase.js in your Gatsby project's src folder.
Create a new file called login.js in your Gatsby project's pages folder. 
This code defines a new React component called LoginPage that renders a login form. When the user submits the form, the handleSubmit function is called, which attempts to log in the user using the signInWithEmailAndPassword method of the auth object exported from firebase.js. If the login is successful, a message is logged to the console.
Update your Gatsby app's gatsby-config.js file to include the Firebase SDK
Start your Gatsby app by running gatsby develop. You should now be able to access the login page at http://localhost:8000/login.
